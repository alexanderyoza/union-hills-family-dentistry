                    Blanca has worked in the dental field since 2002 as a front office associate and
                    treatment coordinator. Blanca began working with Dr. Yoza in 2009 and enjoys
                    the great family atmosphere as well as the teamâ€™s high standards in patient care.
                    She believes patient trust is very important. She likes to celebrate when a patient
                    takes the last step in finishing treatment and getting them back to a healthy state.
                    Out of the office, Blanca enjoys spending time with her three children and hiking.
